# 🌐 LangGraph Multi-Agent Workflow

This repository demonstrates how to build stateful, multi-agent language model workflows using LangGraph, a powerful framework that combines modular agent design with graph-based logic.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each file in this project contributes to a flexible and scalable architecture:

*   `main.py`: Initializes the LangGraph workflow, defines agent nodes, and sets up graph transitions to control the flow between agents.
*   `agents.py`: Implements modular, reusable agents responsible for specific tasks or decision-making within the workflow.
*   `memory.py`: Manages persistent state, allowing agents to access and update context across interactions.
*   `config.py`: Stores configurable settings like agent parameters, API keys, and graph rules.
*   `api.py` (optional): Exposes the workflow through a FastAPI interface for integration with external services.
*   `utils.py`: Contains helper functions for logging, data processing, and integration with LangSmith for tracking and debugging.

## 🚀 Core Concepts

This project is built on the following LangGraph principles:

*   ✅ **Stateful Workflows**: Preserve and evolve conversation or task state across multiple steps and agent interactions.
*   🤖 **Agents**: Modular components that encapsulate task logic, user interaction, or decision-making.
*   🔁 **Graph Structure**: Workflows are represented as directed graphs. Each node is an agent, and edges define valid transitions.
*   🔄 **Transitions**: Flow is controlled by agent output and current state. Transitions enable flexible routing between agents.
*   🧠 **Memory**: Agents can store and retrieve context across the workflow, improving coherence and decision quality.
*   🧪 **Experiment Tracking**: LangSmith integration allows for tracking performance, debugging, and evaluating agent behavior.

## 🧠 Key Terminology

*   **Node**: A single processing unit or agent in the workflow.
*   **Edge**: A directed connection representing a transition between nodes.
*   **State**: Contextual data shared across agents.
*   **Action**: Task or operation performed by an agent.
*   **Context**: All available information to an agent at a specific step.
